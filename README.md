# Potentiel vorticity
This notebook analyzes atmospheric data using xarray and matplotlib. It calculates brightness temperature differences, zonal means, and potential vorticity to identify tropopause pressure levels. The analysis helps visualize temperature, ozone, and wind patterns across various pressure levels in the atmosphere.
